    "critical": "Add context that under PRC national security law, identification of leadership family members is explicitly defined as a national security issue and state secret.",
    "rationale": "Even if this doesn't automatically make it US national security, it's worth noting to the judge that other jurisdictions explicitly treat this as a national security matter.",
    "example": "Under PRC (People's Republic of China) national security law, identification of leadership family members (such as Xi Mingze) is explicitly defined as a national security issue and state secret. While this does not automatically make it US national security, it provides relevant context that other jurisdictions explicitly treat this matter as a national security concern.",
    "insight": "Providing comparative legal context can help US courts understand the sensitivity of the matter. PRC law explicitly treats leadership family identification as both a national security issue and state secret."
