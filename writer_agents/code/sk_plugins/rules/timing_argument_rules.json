  "recommendations": {
    "critical": "Include the timing argument connecting April 7th, HK claim filing, and June 4th proclamation.",
    "rationale": "This establishes that Harvard's ties to Xi Jinping's daughter became a recognized matter of national security since April 7th, when Plaintiff first wrote Harvard, because the June 4th proclamation came into effect 2 days after the HK claim was filed.",
    "example": "The June 4th proclamation came into effect 2 days after Plaintiff filed the Hong Kong claim in this court, making Harvard's ties to Xi Jinping's daughter a recognized matter of national security since the time Plaintiff first wrote Harvard on April 7th.",
    "insight": "This timing argument is crucial for showing the national security issue was present from the beginning of the case, not just after the proclamation."
