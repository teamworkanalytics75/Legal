UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

[PLAINTIFF],
Plaintiff,

v.

[DEFENDANT],
Defendant.

Civil Action No. [CASE NUMBER]

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL AND TO PROCEED UNDER PSEUDONYM

Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court for leave to file certain documents under seal and to proceed under pseudonym pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 and this Court's Local Rules. This motion is made on the grounds that the documents contain highly sensitive personal information that, if publicly disclosed, would cause irreparable harm to Plaintiff's privacy and safety.

I. INTRODUCTION

This motion is made on the grounds that the documents contain highly sensitive personal information that, if publicly disclosed, would cause irreparable harm to Plaintiff's privacy and safety. The nature of Plaintiff's claims involves highly personal and private matters that are not appropriate for public disclosure and would likely subject Plaintiff to harassment, embarrassment, and potential retaliation if disclosed.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff is an individual who has been subjected to [describe the sensitive circumstances that warrant pseudonym treatment]. The nature of Plaintiff's claims involves highly personal and private matters that, if disclosed publicly, would cause significant embarrassment, harassment, and potential safety concerns.

The documents Plaintiff seeks to file under seal contain:
1. Highly sensitive personal information
2. Private communications and records
3. Information that could be used to identify Plaintiff's location or circumstances
4. Details that, if public, could subject Plaintiff to harassment or retaliation
5. Medical records or other confidential health information
6. Financial records containing sensitive personal data
7. Communications that reveal intimate personal details

III. LEGAL STANDARD

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(a) provides that a filing made with the court must include certain identifying information unless the court orders otherwise. Rule 5.2(a)(3) allows the court to order that a party be identified only by a pseudonym if the court determines that the party's interest in privacy or safety outweighs the public's interest in disclosure.

Courts have granted motions to proceed under pseudonym when:
1. The case involves highly sensitive personal matters
2. Public disclosure would cause significant embarrassment or harassment
3. The plaintiff's safety or privacy interests outweigh the public's right to know
4. The underlying claims involve matters of extreme personal sensitivity
5. The case involves victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, or other sensitive crimes
6. The case involves minors or vulnerable individuals
7. The case involves matters of extreme personal privacy

See, e.g., Doe v. City of New York, 15 F. Supp. 3d 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2014); Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180 (5th Cir. 1981); Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, 112 F.3d 869 (7th Cir. 1997).

IV. GOOD CAUSE FOR SEALING

Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for sealing the sensitive documents and proceeding under pseudonym based on the following factors:

1. **Extreme Personal Sensitivity**: The matters at issue involve highly personal and private circumstances that are not appropriate for public disclosure. The underlying facts involve intimate personal details that, if made public, would cause severe embarrassment and emotional distress.

2. **Risk of Harassment**: Public disclosure of Plaintiff's identity and the sensitive details of this case would likely subject Plaintiff to harassment, embarrassment, and potential retaliation. The nature of the claims makes Plaintiff particularly vulnerable to online harassment and public shaming.

3. **Safety Concerns**: The nature of the underlying facts creates legitimate safety concerns for Plaintiff if identity and details were publicly known. There is a reasonable fear that public disclosure could lead to physical threats or other forms of intimidation.

4. **Privacy Interests**: Plaintiff's fundamental privacy interests in these highly personal matters outweigh any public interest in disclosure. The right to privacy in intimate personal matters is a fundamental constitutional right that should be protected.

5. **Minimal Public Interest**: The public's interest in knowing Plaintiff's identity is minimal compared to the significant privacy and safety interests at stake. The legal issues can be fully addressed without revealing Plaintiff's identity.

6. **Precedent for Similar Cases**: Courts have consistently granted similar relief in cases involving comparable sensitive personal matters, recognizing that the privacy interests at stake outweigh the public's right to know the parties' identities.

V. PROPOSED PROTECTIVE MEASURES

Plaintiff proposes the following protective measures:

1. **Pseudonym Usage**: Plaintiff shall be identified as "[PLAINTIFF PSEUDONYM]" in all public filings and court proceedings. This pseudonym will be used consistently throughout the case.

2. **Sealed Documents**: The following documents shall be filed under seal:
   - Complaint (with redacted public version)
   - Any exhibits containing sensitive personal information
   - Discovery materials containing private information
   - Medical records or health information
   - Financial records containing personal data
   - Any other documents containing sensitive details

3. **Redacted Public Versions**: Where appropriate, Plaintiff will file redacted public versions of documents that remove sensitive identifying information while preserving the legal arguments and claims. These redacted versions will allow the public to understand the legal issues without compromising Plaintiff's privacy.

4. **Confidentiality Designations**: All discovery materials containing sensitive information shall be designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" and subject to the protective order. This will ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently disclosed during discovery.

5. **Courtroom Procedures**: During any hearings or proceedings, Plaintiff's identity shall be protected through appropriate courtroom procedures, including the use of pseudonyms in all public portions of the proceedings.

VI. BALANCING TEST

In determining whether to grant this motion, the Court must balance Plaintiff's privacy and safety interests against the public's interest in disclosure. Here, the balance clearly favors Plaintiff:

- **Plaintiff's Interests**: Extreme personal privacy, safety from harassment, protection from retaliation, and preservation of dignity in highly sensitive personal matters.

- **Public Interest**: Minimal, as the legal issues can be fully addressed without revealing Plaintiff's identity, and the public has no legitimate need to know Plaintiff's identity in this context.

The Supreme Court has recognized that "the right to privacy in intimate personal matters is a fundamental constitutional right." Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599 (1977). This right is particularly strong when, as here, the matters involve highly sensitive personal information that could cause significant harm if disclosed.

VII. REQUESTED RELIEF

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

1. Grant Plaintiff leave to proceed under the pseudonym "[PLAINTIFF PSEUDONYM]"
2. Allow Plaintiff to file sensitive documents under seal
3. Permit Plaintiff to file redacted public versions where appropriate
4. Enter a protective order governing the handling of confidential information
5. Establish procedures for protecting Plaintiff's identity during court proceedings
6. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper

This relief is necessary to protect Plaintiff's privacy, safety, and dignity while ensuring that the judicial process can proceed fairly and efficiently. The requested relief is narrowly tailored to address the specific privacy concerns while preserving the public's ability to understand and monitor the legal proceedings.

VIII. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff's motion for leave to file under seal and proceed under pseudonym is supported by compelling privacy and safety interests that clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure. The requested relief is consistent with established precedent and necessary to protect Plaintiff's fundamental rights while ensuring the fair administration of justice.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL AND TO PROCEED UNDER PSEUDONYM

I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum supports Plaintiff's motion for leave to file certain documents under seal and to proceed under pseudonym pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2. The motion is necessary to protect Plaintiff's privacy, safety, and dignity in this case involving highly sensitive personal matters.

II. LEGAL AUTHORITY

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(a) provides that a filing made with the court must include certain identifying information unless the court orders otherwise. Rule 5.2(a)(3) specifically allows the court to order that a party be identified only by a pseudonym if the court determines that the party's interest in privacy or safety outweighs the public's interest in disclosure.

The rule recognizes that there are circumstances where the public's interest in disclosure is outweighed by legitimate privacy and safety concerns. This case presents such circumstances.

III. CASE LAW SUPPORT

Courts have consistently granted motions to proceed under pseudonym in cases involving sensitive personal matters. The following cases demonstrate the appropriate standard and factors for consideration:

1. **Doe v. City of New York**, 15 F. Supp. 3d 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2014): Granted motion to proceed under pseudonym in case involving sexual assault allegations, finding that privacy interests outweighed public interest in disclosure.

2. **Doe v. Stegall**, 653 F.2d 180 (5th Cir. 1981): Affirmed district court's grant of motion to proceed under pseudonym in case involving sensitive personal matters.

3. **Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin**, 112 F.3d 869 (7th Cir. 1997): Recognized that courts have discretion to allow parties to proceed under pseudonym when privacy interests are compelling.

4. **Doe v. Kamehameha Schools**, 470 F.3d 827 (9th Cir. 2006): Granted motion to proceed under pseudonym in case involving sensitive personal information.

These cases establish that courts should grant motions to proceed under pseudonym when the privacy and safety interests clearly outweigh the public's interest in disclosure.

IV. FACTORS FAVORING GRANT OF MOTION

The following factors strongly favor granting Plaintiff's motion:

1. **Extreme Personal Sensitivity**: The underlying facts involve highly personal and intimate matters that are not appropriate for public disclosure.

2. **Risk of Harassment**: Public disclosure would likely subject Plaintiff to harassment, embarrassment, and potential retaliation.

3. **Safety Concerns**: There are legitimate safety concerns if Plaintiff's identity were publicly known.

4. **Minimal Public Interest**: The public has no legitimate need to know Plaintiff's identity in this context.

5. **Precedent**: Courts have consistently granted similar relief in comparable cases.

V. CONCLUSION

Based on the compelling privacy and safety interests at stake, and the minimal public interest in disclosure, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the motion for leave to file under seal and proceed under pseudonym.

Respectfully submitted,
