## How Plugins Work

1. **Automatic Loading:** Plugins are loaded by the case enforcement plugin generator at runtime
2. **Citation Checking:** Each plugin checks if its case is properly cited in drafts
3. **Edit Requests:** If citations are missing, plugins generate edit requests to add them
4. **Validation:** Plugins verify that key holdings are referenced
5. **Location-Specific:** Plugins can insert citations at appropriate locations in the document

## Next Steps

The plugins are now part of your system and will:
- ✅ Automatically enforce citation of these supporting cases
- ✅ Check that key precedents are mentioned
- ✅ Generate edit requests if citations are missing
- ✅ Work with the RefinementLoop to improve drafts

## Testing

To test the plugins:
1. Create a Section 1782 motion draft
2. Run it through the Conductor workflow
3. Check validation results - plugins should flag missing citations
4. Review edit requests - plugins should suggest adding citations

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `case_law_data/unified_corpus.db` - Cases tagged and classified
2. ✅ `writer_agents/config/plugin_registry.json` - 4 new plugins added
3. ✅ `rules_registry/output/MASTERCHECKLISTEXPANDED.md` - 3 new case entries
4. ✅ `writer_agents/docs/NATIONAL_SECURITY_SEALING_CASES.md` - Documentation created

All changes are complete and ready for use!
